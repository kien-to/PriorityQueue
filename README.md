# PriorityQueue
Implement a futuristic automated emergency room (ER) triage system. This system will receive data in the form of patient and injury pairs over time and automatically assign patients to doctors as the resources become available depending on the severity of the patient’s injury. the order of data serving is based on a priority of each datum – in this scenario, the priority of each patient is commensurate with the severity of their injury or age of the patient (depending on the comparator being used). Importantly, a priority queue accomplishes this task in an efficient way. Despite this specific setting, this implementation will be generic enough to work with all types of data and could be applied to other real world problems.
